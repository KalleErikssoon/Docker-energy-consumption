# Docker-energy-consumption

Repository for storing different Dockerfiles which we will use to compare energy consumption in Docker containers.
We will compare energy consumption in Docker containers using different base images (Alpine and Debian) running TPC-C and TPC-H benchmarks.
We will then debloat the containers and run the same benchmarks to see if this has any effect on the energy consumption in the containers.
